Prerequisites
Python==2.7
faiss==1.5.3
tensorflow==1.12

Install Faiss-GPU based on the instructions here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/master/INSTALL.md


Training
Training on the existing datasets
You can use python main.py --dataset {dataset_name} to train a specific model on a dataset. Other hyperparameters can be found in the code.

For example, you can use python main.py --dataset ml-1m to train HashGNN model on MovieLens dataset.

The current implmentation is a litter bit difference from the original one, since we reimplement the sampling function based on the samplestore package of PAI platform at Alibaba.


Acknowledgement
The implementation of straight-through estimator is based on https://r2rt.com/binary-stochastic-neurons-in-tensorflow.html.
